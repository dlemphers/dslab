# DS Lab is a simple project for running data science experiments in Jupyter locally.

## Usage

## Configure for your own use

In the `Makefile`, there are two config variables
- PROJECT
- CONTAINER_IMAGE

Both are used by the `Makefile` to build and control where your underlying image is stored and the name of your running container.

Change these values, especially `CONTAINER_IMAGE` if you want to build and manage your own
